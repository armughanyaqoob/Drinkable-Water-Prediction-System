# Drinkable-Water-Prediction-System


Water is a fundamental necessity for all living beings. It plays a vital role in various bodily functions, such as temperature regulation and blood circulation, making it essential for personal health. Moreover, water supports diverse ecosystems, serving as a drinking source and habitat for a wide range of animal species. Beyond individual well-being, water is also integral to numerous industries, including food production and medicine.

Unfortunately, in today's world, access to uncontaminated water is not as widespread as one might expect. To tackle this challenge, this project collects water samples from multiple sources and determines their drinkability using several important indicators.


## Introduction

The goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately predict the potability of water samples. This involves analyzing various features of the water samples to determine if they are safe for consumption.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes several features of water samples collected from different sources. These features include ph, Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, Sulfate, Conductivity, Organic_carbon, Trihalomethanes and Turbidity etc
